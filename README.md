2. *Requirement Gathering* – Collect user and bank requirements.
3. *System Analysis* – Study existing systems and identify improvements.
4. *System Design* – Plan system architecture and data flow.
5. *Functional Specification* – Define what the system should do (withdraw, deposit, transfer, etc.).
6. *Non-Functional Specification* – Define performance, security, and reliability needs.
7. *Testing & Validation* – Check if the system meets all requirements.
8. *Documentation & Maintenance* – Prepare reports and update the system as needed.
